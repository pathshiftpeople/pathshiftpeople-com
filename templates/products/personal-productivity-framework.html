    <p><b>Whatever your productivity system, this framework will help you improve it.</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>If you're a knowledge worker who feels at least occasionally overwhelmed by the firehose of content and tasks coming at you every day, these courses are for you.</p>
    <h2>Course at a glance</h2>
    <p>Spending time improving your personal productivity has always been an investments which keeps on generating compound interest throughout your life ... as long as you don't get addicted to productivity porn and end up spending more time tweaking your system than actually using it to get things done.</p>
    <p>This framework helps you design a personal productivity system that meets your unique needs, rather than training you to adopt someone else's. And it ensures that the resulting system saves you more time than you actually spend developing and refining the system.</p>
    <p>No prior knowledge is required, and the course is technology-agnostic. However I will show you the specific tools I use in order to illustrate the general principles of the framework, and you can always quiz me about them if you take the "Q&A" version.<br>Which brings me to...</p>
