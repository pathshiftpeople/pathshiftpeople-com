    <h2>Courses at a glance</h2>
    <h3>Who are these courses for?</h3>
    <p>If you're a knowledge worker who feels at least occasionally overwhelmed by the firehose of content and tasks coming at you every day, these courses are for you.</p>
    <p>Investing in improving your personal productivity will generate compound interest throughout your life ... as long as you don't get addicted to productivity porn and end up spending more time tweaking your system than actually using it to get things done.</p>
    <p>This framework therefore helps you design a personal productivity system that meets your unique needs, rather than training you to adopt someone else's. And it ensures that the resulting system saves you more time than you actually spend developing and refining the system. </p>
    <p>No prior knowledge is required, and the course is technology-agnostic. However we will show you the specific tools we use to illustrate the framework's general principles, and you can always quiz us about them if you take the "Q&A" version.</p>
    <p>Which brings me to...</p>
    <h3>Two Versions</h3>
    <p>The course comes in two versions:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><b>v2: Personal Productivity Framework with Q&A -</b> The same content as version 1, above, but with an AMA (Ask Mathew Anything) webinar, held twice a week:
